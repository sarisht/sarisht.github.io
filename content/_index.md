        My research aims to understand and mitigate the security challenges introduced by strategic privileged players (e.g., block proposers) in decentralized systems. My projects explore both application-specific solutions for incentive manipulation and application-agnostic schemes for Minerâ€™s Extractable Value (MEV) reduction. Overall, my goal is to develop principled methods to achieve accountable decentralized protocols, particularly in the presence of adversarial incentive manipulation attacks.
